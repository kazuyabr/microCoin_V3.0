microCoin version 2.2.0.1 update
After one month there will be around 30850000000 old microCoins.
This coins can change to new microCoins with price 1 MRC = 1 New MRC.
After all 30850000000 coins are sold, old microCoin network is not valid anymore.
So there is about one month time period to change old microCoins.

If old MRC network stop, we need stop old MRC market before 30850000000. 
On that case, rest of coins will be deleted.
